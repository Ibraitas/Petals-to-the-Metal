# Petals-to-the-Metal

## Competition description

It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and diverse our natural world is.

There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000 species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000 different types of flowers.

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images (for simplicity, we’re sticking to just over 100 types).

## Data

[Dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tpu-getting-started/data)

## Results

+ Orginized images of different flowers from Kaggle dataset, labeled them;
+ Picked up the right learning rate scheduler for network;
+ Augmented data with custom rotation;
+ Build network using keras.Sequential based on DenseNet201 to classify images.

## Resources used

+ Python Version: 3.7.4;
+ Packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, kaggle_datasets, random, re, math;
+ [TPU](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs).
